# 🕒 Crawlrabbit Uptime Monitor

This repository powers the **Crawlrabbit Status Page**, an automated uptime and performance monitoring system built with **[Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime)**.

It monitors the availability of **[https://crawlrabbit.com/](https://crawlrabbit.com/)** and publishes a public status page using **GitHub Actions, Issues, and GitHub Pages** — no servers required.
